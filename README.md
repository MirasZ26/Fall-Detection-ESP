# Fall-Detection-ESP
Code files in the ESP-WROOM-32 for the Fall Detection project
The main goal of this project is to design a device that would assist in cases of emergency falls of elderly people, people with risks of fainting and having seizures of different kinds. 
The main hypothesis is that it is achievable to develop an affordable fall detection device that would share individually tailored first aid instructions for many medical conditions to the people nearby and alert patientsâ€™ close people and emergency services about the incident via phone and email. The device is also expected to distinguish between different kinds of falls (mild and severe), connect to the Internet of Things, AND have access to GPS services to send fall detection alerts to people nearby. 
According to the study, kinematic signals and wearable technology are the most efficient fall detection methods. The device's functionality includes detecting and distinguishing between mild and severe falls and notifying chosen contacts via email and SMS.
